NYU Voice is a web-based application designed for communication and social life between members of the NYU community.

NYU Voice provides authentic, reliable, and credible content as a reliable source of information for members of the NYU community. The project would allow students to share course information and review, rating restaurants, and build their network with each other to reach the goal of promoting an inclusive and peaceful community. NYU Voice shall use specific methods to verify that the user is within the NYU community, such as verifying the email address or NYU Albert and will link their account with an official NYU account. The project shall include the following functions: 
- NYU Voice Account Registration
- Direct Message
- Restaurant Rating
- Class Review and Rating

The platform will allow users to create a personal profile with their nicknames displayed to other users. Based on the identity of NYU faculty, students, or alumni, users will be categorized and given access to different sections explicitly designed for different groups. 

For NYU faculty, students, or alumni, each would have different access depending on their identity. NYU students could write class reviews for classes they had already taken. Professors or students not related to this course may not have access to the review page. 

As a software-only product, NYU Voice is covered by the standard, which applies to all forms of software products, including web applications, infrastructure, and operational scripts. The SDD for NYU Voice is delivered as part of the software product release package.
